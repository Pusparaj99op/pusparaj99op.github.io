## üîß Setup and Installation
To run this project locally:

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Pusparaj99op/pusparaj99op.github.io.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
```bash
cd pusparaj99op.github.io
```

3. Open the `index.html` file in your browser or use a local development server.

## üì§ Deployment
This website is deployed using GitHub Pages. To deploy your own version:

1. Create a GitHub repository named `username.github.io` (replace 'username' with your GitHub username)
2. Add your website files to the repository
3. Use the following git commands to push your changes:

```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/Pusparaj99op/pusparaj99op.github.io.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

Once pushed, the site will be automatically available at `https://pusparaj99op.github.io/`.

## üìã Git Command Explanation
- `git remote add origin https://github.com/Pusparaj99op/pusparaj99op.github.io.git`
  - This command connects your local repository to the remote GitHub repository.
  - It defines "origin" as a shorthand name for the remote repository URL.

- `git branch -M main`
  - This renames your current branch to "main" (the new standard default branch name).
  - The -M flag forces the rename even if the new branch name already exists.

- `git push -u origin main`
  - This pushes your local "main" branch to the remote repository named "origin".
  - The -u flag (or --set-upstream) sets the upstream relationship, allowing you to use `git pull` and `git push` without arguments in the future.

## üîÑ Making Updates
To update your website after making changes:

1. Add the changed files:
```bash
git add .
```

2. Commit your changes:
```bash
git commit -m "Description of changes"
```

3. Push to GitHub:
```bash
git push
```
